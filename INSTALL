INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR RITA

Warning:
1. Before installing check that the libraries ofeli and gmsh are installed correctly.
2. The installation procedure uses cmake. If you don't hacve cmake or don't want to
install it, you can download the compiled version according to you operating system. 


After unzipping and untarring the rita package file, let's go to the created
directory (where the file INSTALL is).
You now have to create a directory, which we will call 'build'.

Do:

  cd build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build .

This creates the executable file 'rita' in the subdirectory 'src'.
You can now run the tests by typing

ctest

All tests are run. If you prefer to display test outputs, type

ctest --verbose

Now, everything is ready (if tests are run successfully). You can install the application on your
computer by typing 

make install

This command may require administrator privileges.

You can adjust the installation destination (the "prefix")
by passing the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=myprefix option to cmake, as is
explained in the message that cmake prints at the end.
